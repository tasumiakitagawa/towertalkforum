      "content": "The current meta has shifted significantly with the latest patch. Here are the top 5 heroes dominating ranked matches:\n\n**1. Invoker**\nWith recent buffs to his spell damage, Invoker has become a force to be reckoned with in the mid lane. His versatility makes him a top pick in high-level games.\n\n**2. Pudge**\nThe hook master is back! Pudge's hook range buff has made him extremely popular in both ranked and casual matches. His ability to turn fights around with a single hook is unmatched.\n\n**3. Phantom Assassin**\nPA's critical strike chance has been increased, making her one of the most dangerous carries in the late game. She's a must-ban in most ranked games.\n\n**4. Earthshaker**\nWith the new Aghanim's Scepter upgrade, Earthshaker's Echo Slam has become even more devastating. He's a top-tier support/offlaner.\n\n**5. Storm Spirit**\nThe electric hero has seen a resurgence with mana cost reductions. His mobility and burst damage make him a nightmare for squishy heroes.\n\nWhat heroes are you seeing most in your games?",
